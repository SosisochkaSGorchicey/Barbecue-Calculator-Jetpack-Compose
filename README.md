Basically it is a calculator that counts an ideal amount of meat based on:

The UI of this application is made with the help of a library Jetpack Compose.

This application is published in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.my.shashlik) and has two languages - English and Russian. Those beautiful images were painted by my friend, so please do not use them in your projects.

"Barbecue Calculator" can *deffenetly* be improved, but it works and this is already a great success for me! :nerd_face: If you have any advices for my application I would love to receive them on my email - shashlik.app@yandex.ru.:revolving_hearts:
